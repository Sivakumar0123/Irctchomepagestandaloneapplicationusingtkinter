''' What is Python ? '''

    # WORA language - write once runs anywhere

    # pure object oriented programming language

    # pure oops bcoz of data structure & classes and objects

    # cross platform lang (platform independent)

    # interpreted language(checking the data type of a value only at runtime - line by line execution

    # it converts source code to machine code then execute it

    # multipradigm lang - (procedural programming + oop + structural programming +modular programming

    # dynamically typed lang (checking the exact datatype of a value @ runtime)

    # duck typed lang (type checking + type conversion +naming convenation)

    # beginner friendly lang

    # expressive lang ( tells all the bultin function for certain values)

    # automatic memory mapping lang

    # rapid prototyping lang (rapid - fast , prototyping - design)

    # general purpose lang ( programming , coding , scripting, testing , automation)

''' python general features '''

''' what python receives from other lang '''
 
   # takes functional programming from c lang
 
   # takes oop concepts from c++ lang
 
   # modular programming from modula3 lang

''' what python offers '''

   # large standard libraries
   
   # lesser code optimization
   
   # automatic memory mapping
   
   # extension support

'''Python color schemes'''

   # purple - builtin function
   # orange - keywords ( reserved words )
   # green - unicode strings enclosed with in quotations
   # blue - processed output value
   # red - error / exception / single line

'''python language constructs / python tokens '''

   # identifiers

   # literals
   
   # operators
   
   # keywords
   
   # comments
   
   # quotations

''' identifiers '''

   # identifiers in common represents name, value, variable(value container)
 
   # Identifiers in python usually returns the named memory reference location of a value

''' example '''
   
   # a = 10 (a -> variable, 10 -> value)

''' Rules '''
   
   # keywords cannot be used as identifiers
   
   # builtin functions cannot be used as identifiers
   
   # identifiers cannot start with number
   
   # identifiers are always strt with alphabets or _alphabets

''' literals '''

   # literals

   # checking the exact datatype of a value stored in a variable

''' example '''

   # a=10
   # type(a)
   # <class 'int'>

''' operators '''

   # operators - collecting values from more than one operand variables at a time

'''arithmetic operators( + - * / % // ) '''

# addation
   20+3
   23
# subraction  
   30-2

# multiplication 
  30*3

# division

# modulo  
  30%4

# floar division (it returns only quotient value)
